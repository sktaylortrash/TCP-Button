> Controls lights managed with https://github.com/bren1818/TCPLightingWebInterface

All testing was performed with NodeMCU development boards V2 but should be reproducable on any esp8266 based board. The NodeMCU board was chosen as it already has a 5v --> 3.3v convertor and breadboad sized pinouts attached
